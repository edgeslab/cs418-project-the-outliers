# Setup and Running

Run the Jupyter notebook with 

```
$ cd spotify-analysis
$ jupyter notebook &
``` 

this will run Jupyter in a Browser window and from there you can view the contents of our notebook under  SpotifyAnalysis.ipynb.

To run the python application you will need to obtain an API Key from the Spotify Developer API. 
Copy the API key and secret into a file called `api_key.py` under the spotify-analysis folder.
You can use the template `api_key_template.py` for reference. 

After this is complete, you can run the code with

```
$ cd spotify-analysis
$ python main.py
```
